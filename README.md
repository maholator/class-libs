# MT class libs

Helper dll for MT. Hosts binary libs that MT loads into itself.

## Source code / license

All classes not obfuscated (so MT can parse them). Use any decompiler to check their content directly.

If not specified explicitly, classes are taken from [KEmulator nnmod](https://github.com/shinovon/KEmulator)
or [J2MELoader](https://github.com/nikita36078/J2ME-Loader). Check git commit messages for each file to learn details. Check their licenses/sources for further action.
